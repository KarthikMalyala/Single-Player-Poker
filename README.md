# Single-Player-Poker
Using OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) Concepts in C++, I have created this single-player Poker game that enables users to have a variety of hands over the course and have a balance to place bets. This lab compiles a single player Poker game with a Base Class and Class Methods. The user starts with 100 chips ($1.00 each) and is given a randomized hand of four cards from a deck of 36 cards. Winning possibilities include 4ofAKind, Straight Flush, Flush, Straight, 3ofAKind, Two Pair, Pair, and Bubkiss. This
can be played as long as the user wishes to play and has enough chips. A Final report will be generated with amount of wins, losses, hands, and net winnings.
